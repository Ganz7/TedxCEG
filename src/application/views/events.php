					<p>Everyone in this competitive world wants to taste success but the road to success has never been straight. It comes with a lot of twists and turns. All it takes to stand out from the others is how and when one makes the turn. True to this, people who took the crucial turn in their career making a transition from one stream to a radically different stream have been successful in etching their names in the pages of history. They stand as strong examples for taking that one daring step that has transformed them from the ordinary to the extraordinary. This year, TEDxCEG is an ode to all those extraordinary people who overcame the fear of failure and took the unusual turn in their careers to do what their heart desired.</p>
